# 🚀 LeetCode Daily Challenge Repository

Welcome to my **LeetCode Daily Practice Repository**!  
This repository is dedicated to solving **LeetCode problems on a daily basis** using multiple programming languages.

My goal is to build **strong problem-solving skills**, improve **DSA fundamentals**, and stay **consistent** with daily coding.

## 🧠 Languages Covered

I solve problems using the following languages:

- ☕ **Java**
- 🟨 **JavaScript**
- 🛢 **SQL**
- ➕ More languages may be added in the future
